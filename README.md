# FleetDefense Sim

Inspired by the chapter [A Dance of Vampires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo8FhChnyq0) from Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising, where a flight of Soviet Bombers destroys an American carrier fleet, I want to make a somewhat realistic simulation to replicate it.
This repo is (will be eventually) a somewhat realistic, physics based simulation with AI agents taking the place of the decision makers. 

Tentative Roadmap

* [] Implement entities (jets, missiles, radars, etc)
* [] Implement simulation framework
* [] Implement simple, heuristic based AI agents
* [] Explore machine learning approaches to replace simple agents
